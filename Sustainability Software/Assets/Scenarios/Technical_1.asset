  clientBrief: "I\u2019m the operations manager at a logistics company, and our fleet
    and data systems are a nightmare. Fuel use is high, our servers run 24/7, and
    we can\u2019t seem to get accurate analytics to improve efficiency. We know technology
    can help, but we\u2019re not sure where to invest first. Can you advise us?"
  choices:
  - choiceText: Upgrade our fleet with GPS tracking and route optimization software.
    reflection: Cuts fuel use and delivery times, but requires training drivers and
      staff.
  - choiceText: Migrate our on-premise servers to a cloud provider with renewable
      energy data centers.
    reflection: Reduces energy demand and maintenance overhead, but involves data
      security considerations.
  - choiceText: Implement IoT sensors on vehicles and warehouses to monitor energy
      and fuel consumption in real time.
    reflection: Provides precise data for decision-making, though setup costs and
      system integration are complex.
  - choiceText: Develop a custom AI dashboard to analyze patterns and suggest sustainability
      improvements.
    reflection: Powerful insights, but requires strong data pipelines and technical
      expertise to succeed.
  reflectionFeedback: 'Technical sustainability often starts with data and efficiency:
    route optimization saves fuel, cloud migration reduces emissions, IoT enables
    monitoring, and AI delivers insights. The challenge is aligning technology investment
    with organizational capacity.'
