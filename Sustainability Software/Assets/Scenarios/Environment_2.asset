  clientBrief: "We run a neighborhood grocery store, and lately we\u2019ve been under
    pressure to reduce our environmental footprint. Our energy bills are huge, and
    we feel guilty about how much food we throw away. We don\u2019t know where to
    start\u2014can you help us make the right choice?"
  choices:
  - choiceText: Install energy-efficient refrigeration units.
    reflection: This reduces energy use and lowers carbon emissions long-term.
  - choiceText: Start a composting program for unsold produce.
    reflection: Keeps organic waste out of landfills and creates useful compost.
  - choiceText: Switch to plastic-free packaging for all products.
    reflection: Reduces plastic pollution, though it may increase costs.
  - choiceText: Partner with local farms to donate excess food.
    reflection: Helps the community and avoids food waste.
  reflectionFeedback: 'Each option addresses sustainability in different ways: energy
    efficiency reduces emissions, composting prevents landfill waste, and plastic-free
    packaging reduces pollution.'
