  clientBrief: "We\u2019re preparing to launch a fitness tracking platform. Right
    now, we\u2019re hosting everything in a coal-heavy region because it\u2019s cheap
    and fast. Our sustainability audit flagged this as a major issue. We want to
    lower our environmental impact without compromising too much on service. What
    should we do?"
  choices:
  - choiceText: Keep servers in the coal region and add more capacity.
    clientReaction: This keeps performance strong, but our emissions have skyrocketed.
      Investors may question our green commitments.
    reflection: Scaling in a coal-heavy region increased emissions by 80%. This shows
      how short-term performance can worsen environmental sustainability.
  - choiceText: Migrate to a region powered by renewable energy.
    clientReaction: "Great news for sustainability! I\u2019m worried some users may
      experience slower connections, though."
    reflection: By switching to renewables, emissions dropped by 60%. This demonstrates
      how infrastructure choices directly impact environmental sustainability.
  - choiceText: Implement video compression, caching, and efficient code to reduce
      server load.
    clientReaction: I love that this lowers energy use! But it does mean our developers
      are under pressure to optimize quickly.
    reflection: Optimizing software reduced energy use by ~30%. Efficiency-focused
      software design is a core principle of environmental sustainability.
  - choiceText: Buy carbon credits to offset emissions from coal servers.
    clientReaction: This improves our public image, but the underlying emissions
      problem remains.
    reflection: This improves our public image, but the underlying emissions problem
      remains.
  reflectionFeedback: In this lesson, you explored environmental strategies for sustainable
    cloud hosting. You learned that where and how your software runs greatly affects
    emissions.
